# Spread-of-forest-fires-and-infectious-disease
This project aims to create a simple model to simulate forest fires.
Forest Fire and Disease Spread Model
This repository contains code for a simulation model developed as part of a class project in Earth System Modeling. The model is initially designed to simulate the spread of forest fires but can be extended to represent the spread of infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola), illustrating the concept of universality in modeling. Universality suggests that similar rules or equations can describe seemingly different phenomena, such as fire spread and disease transmission.

## Priciple
**Green squares** represent forest.
**Red squares** represent areas where the forest is currently on fire.

This project conducts numerical experiments with different parameters to understand how factors like forest density and probability of fire spread impact fire behavior. (feel free to change the **'Probablities for empty spots and trees on fire'**. I set it randomly)
